## **Key Aspect:**
	~ According to the above table, the password will be so strong when the password has more than 12 characters.
	~ Not only the characters, including special characters like Symbols(e.g !, @, #, $, %) would make the password unbreakable.
## **Tools used:**
	~ password meter [url: www.passwordmonster.com]
